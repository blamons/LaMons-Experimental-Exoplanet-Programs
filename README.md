# LaMons-Experimental-Exoplanet-Programs
This repository contains my two largest projects: a GNN light curve classifier and a liquid iron equation of state (EoS) program (currently a work in progress) and will be part of my model of the terrestrial core of a gas giant. Once completed, it will be combined with code from my grad student mentor to form a complete gas giant modeling program.
