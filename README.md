# LaMons-Experimental-Exoplanet-Programs
This repository contains my two largest projects: a GNN light curve classifier and a solid iron equation of state (EoS) program (currently a work in progress) and will be part of my model of the terrestrial core of a gas giant. Once completed, it will be combined with code from my grad student mentor to form a complete gas giant modeling program.

To clarify, the solid iron EoS program is called "LaMons_Iron_EoS_Tests_2.2_Solid_clean.ipynb", the data tables it relies upon can be found in the EoS Program Dependencies folder, and the log detailing how I coded it over time since I started working on it in May can be found in the two pdf files labeled "Planetary Formation & EoS Program - Project Journal & Log" (there are two parts, labeled first and second component, respectively). 

The GNN that classifies light curves from TESS data is called "LaMons_LightCurve_Classifier_Updated.ipynb", and the log describing how I wrote it throughout my junior year at Regis is labeled "GNN Tess Light Curve Classifier - Project Journal & Log (2024-2025).pdf".
