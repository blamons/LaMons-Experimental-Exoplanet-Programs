# LaMons-Experimental-Exoplanet-Programs
This repository contains my two largest projects: a GNN light curve classifier and a solid iron equation of state (EoS) program (currently a work in progress) and will be part of my model of the terrestrial core of a gas giant. Once completed, it will be combined with code from my grad student mentor to form a complete gas giant modeling program.

To clarify, the solid iron EoS program is called "LaMons_Iron_EoS_Tests_2.2_Solid_clean.
